*open-associated-programs.txt*  Open files and web pages in associated programs from Vim

The 'open.vim' plug-in knows how to open files, directories, URLs and e-mail
addresses from inside Vim using the associated programs. It should work on
Windows, Mac OS X and most Linux installations.

This plug-in doesn't define any mappings or commands so that other Vim
plug-ins that need to launch a web browser can easily bundle the 'open.vim'
script. If you are looking for mappings / commands you can try my shell.vim
plugin [1].

==============================================================================
Installation ~

Unzip the most recent ZIP archive [2] file inside your Vim profile directory
(usually this is '~/.vim' on UNIX and '%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles' on Windows),
restart Vim and execute the command ':helptags ~/.vim/doc' (use ':helptags
~\vimfiles\doc' instead on Windows).

Note that on Windows a command prompt window pops up temporarily when either
of the functions is called. If this bothers you then you can install my
shell.vim [1] plug-in which includes a DLL [3] that works around this issue.
Once you’ve installed both plug-ins it should work out of the box!

==============================================================================
Usage ~

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *xolox#open#file()* function

This function takes a string argument containing a file or directory path and
opens it just like double clicking the file or directory in your desktop
environment would do. This means directories are opened in your file manager,
image files are opened in an image viewer, ZIP files are opened in an
archiving application, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *xolox#open#url()* function

This function takes a string argument containing a URL or e-mail address and
opens it in your favorite or the best available web browser / e-mail client.
