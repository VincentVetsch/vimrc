       The Hebrew calendar follows a seven-day weekly cycle, which runs
       concurrently but independently of the monthly and annual cycles.
       The names for the days of the week are simply the day number within
       the week. In Hebrew, these names may be abbreviated using the
       numerical value of the Hebrew letters, for example יום א׳ (Day 1,
       or Yom Rishon (יום ראשון)):
             Yom Rishon -   יום ראשון (abbreviated יום א׳) = "first day" =
                            Sunday (starting at preceding sunset)
             Yom Sheni -    יום שני (abbr. יום ב׳) = "second day" = Monday
             Yom Shlishi -  יום שלישי (abbr. יום ג׳) = "third day" = Tuesday
             Yom Reviʻi -   יום רביעי (abbr. יום ד׳) = "fourth day" = Wednesday
             Yom Chamishi - יום חמישי (abbr. יום ה׳) = "fifth day" = Thursday
             Yom Shishi -   יום ששי (abbr. יום ו׳) = "sixth day" = Friday
             Yom Shabbat -  יום שבת (abbr. יום ש׳) or more usually שבת -

                  which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from
                  all his work which he had made. 2:3 And God blessed the
                  seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had
                  rested from all his work which God created and made.
                  • Exodus 16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will

                  out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove
                  them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.
                  • Exodus 16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth
                  day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it
                  shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
                  • Exodus 20:8 Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy
                  • Exodus 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy
                  work: 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD
                  thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy
                  son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant,
                  nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
                  20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the
                  sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day:
                  wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed

                  • Constantine created the earliest Sunday law known to
                  history in AD 321. It says this: On the venerable Day of
                  the sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities
                  rest, and let all workshops be closed. In the country,
                  however, persons engaged in agriculture may freely and
                  lawfully continue their pursuits: because it often happens
                  that another Day is not so suitable for grain sowing or for
                  vine planting: lest by neglecting the proper moment for
                  such operations the bounty of heaven should be lost.ii
                  • Colossians 2:14-17 says, "He canceled the record of the
                  charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the
                  cross. In this way, he disarmed the spiritual rulers and
                  authorities. He shamed them publicly by his victory over
                  them on the cross. So don’t let anyone condemn you for what
                  you eat or drink, or for not celebrating certain holy days
                  or new moon ceremonies or Sabbaths. For these rules are
                  only shadows of the reality yet to come. And Christ himself
                  is that reality.”
                  • Romans 14:5-6, "One man considers one day more sacred than
                  another; another man considers every day alike. Each one
                  should be fully convinced in his own mind. He who regards
                  one day as special, does so to the Lord. He who eats meat,
                  eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who
                  abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God."
            ▪ Idol of Jesus Christ
               ▫ Exodus 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
               image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above,
               or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under
               the earth.
               ▫ Leviticus 19:4 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to
               yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God
               ▫ Leviticus 26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image,
               neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up
               any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am
               the LORD your God.
            ▪ Idol of Druid Witch-Craft triquetra on the pulpit
               ▫ Sign on the Aquirian Age (New Age Movement)
               ▫ The triqueta symbol predates Christianity and was likely a
                 Celtic symbol of the Goddess, and in the North, a symbol of
                 the god Odin. Although it is often asserted that the
                 triquetra is a symbol of a tripartite goddess, no such
                 goddess has been identified with the symbol. Similar symbols
                 do occur in some Norse and Celtic goddess imagery, but most
                 likely represents the divisions of the animal kingdom and
                 the three domains of earth mentioned above.

                 Triplicities were common symbols in Celtic myth and legend,
                 one of the possible reasons Christian beliefs were so easily
                 adopted by the Celtic people. The triqueta makes an ideal
                 Christian symbol. It is a perfect representation of the
                 concept of “three in one” in Christian trinity beliefs, and
                 incorporates another popular Christian symbol, the fish, in
                 its original form of the vesica pisces. It is sometimes
                 enclosed within a circle to emphasize the unity aspect.

                 In Wiccan and Neopagan belief, the triqueta symbolizes the
                 triple aspected goddess (maid, mother, and crone). Some
                 Christians have protested this “appropriation” of the
                 symbol…however, ironically enough, the original Christian
                 fish symbol was derived from an early symbol of venus, one
                 representing female generative organs- making the triquetra
                 perfectly appropriate symbol for a Goddess revival. The
                 triquetra is also considered to represent the triplicities
                 of mind, body, and soul, as well as the three domains of
                 earth according to Celtic mythology- earth, sea, and sky.

                 The triquetra also appears on the television series Charmed,
                 probably as a less threatening alternative to the pentacle
                 (the preferred emblem of witches real and imaginary). In the
                 show, it represents the “power of three, acting as one,”
                 which in turn represents the three sisters.Evangelical tract
                 writers and conspiracy theorists like to label the triquetra
                 a ‘satanic’ symbol, claiming it is a ‘stylized’ 666, an
                 allusion to the ‘number of the beast’ in the Book of
                 Revelation. This, however, is simply wishful thinking. The
                 triquetra of interlaced fishes is one of the very earliest
                 of Christian symbols, predating the crucifix by hundreds of
                 years. The purported ‘satanic’ meaning of the symbol is a
                 modern evangelical interpolation.

      Nicolaitanes — Gnosticism:
         Nicolaism (also Nicholaism, Nicolationism, or Nicolaitanism) is a
         Christian heresy, first mentioned (twice) in the Book of Revelation of
         the New Testament, whose adherents were called Nicolaitans,
         Nicolaitanes, or Nicolaites. According to Revelation 2, vv. 6 and 15,
         they were known in the cities of Ephesus and Pergamon. In this
         chapter, the church at Ephesus is commended for "hating the deeds of
         the Nicolaitans, which I also hate" and the church in Pergamon is
         blamed for "having them who hold their [the Nicolaitans'] doctrines".
         There is no other first-hand evidence to give us certainty about the
         nature of this sect.

         Hippolytus of Rome states that the deacon Nicolas was the author of
         the heresy and the sect.[2] Several of the early church fathers,
         including Irenaeus, Epiphanius, and Theodoret mentioned this group.
         Irenaeus discusses them but adds nothing to the Apocalypse except that
         "they lead lives of ‘unrestrained indulgence.’" Victorinus of Pettau
         states that they ‘ate things offered to idols’. Bede states that
         Nicolas allowed other men to marry his wife and Thomas Aquinas
         believed that Nicholas supported either ‘polygamy or the holding of
         wives in common’. Eusebius said that the sect was short-lived.
      Sudden Destruction:
       I Thess. 5:2-6
          5:1 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I
          write unto you.
          5:2 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh
          as a thief in the night.
          5:3 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction
          cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall
          not escape.
          5:4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
          overtake you as a thief.
          5:5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we
          are not of the night, nor of darkness.
          5:6 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be
          sober.
       II Thes 2:
          9 [Even him], whose coming is after the working of Satan with all
            power and signs and lying wonders,
          10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that
             perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that
             they might be saved.
          11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they
             should believe a lie:
          12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had
             pleasure in unrighteousness.
       I Cor. 15:51-52
          15:51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
             shall all be changed, 15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an
             eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead
             shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
       Rev. 3:3
          3:3 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
          fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on
          thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon
          thee.
       II Peter 3:10
          3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
             the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the
             elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the
             works that are therein shall be burned up.
       Matt 24:43-44
          24:43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in
             what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and
             would not have suffered his house to be broken up.
          24:44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think
             not the Son of man cometh.
       Matt 24:50-51
          24:48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
             delayeth his coming; 24:49 And shall begin to smite his
             fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; 24:50 The
             lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for
             him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, 24:51 And shall cut
             him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites:
             there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
       Matt 25:13
          25:13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
             wherein the Son of man cometh.
       I Thess. 5:4-6
          5:4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
          overtake you as a thief.
          5:5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we
          are not of the night, nor of darkness.
          5:6 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be
          sober.
       I Thess. 5:9-11
          5:9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by
          our Lord Jesus Christ, 5:10 Who died for us, that, whether we wake
          or sleep, we should live together with him.
          5:11 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,
          even as also ye do.
      Jeremiah 51:
         This is America:
         51:1 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and
            against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against
            me, a destroying wind; 51:2 And will send unto Babylon fanners,
            that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of
            trouble they shall be against her round about.
         51:3 Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against
            him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her
            young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.
         51:4 Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they
            that are thrust through in her streets.
         51:5 For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the
            LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the
            Holy One of Israel.
         51:6 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul:
            be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's
            vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.
         51:7 Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all
            the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore
            the nations are mad.
         51:8 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm
            for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
         51:9 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her,
            and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment
            reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.
         51:10 The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us
            declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.
         51:11 Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised
            up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against
            Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD,
            the vengeance of his temple.
         51:12 Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch
            strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD
            hath both devised and done that which he spake against the
            inhabitants of Babylon.
         51:13 O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures,
            thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.
         51:14 The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will
            fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a
            shout against thee.
         51:15 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
            world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his
            understanding.
         51:16 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in
            the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of
            the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the
            wind out of his treasures.
         51:17 Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is
            confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood,
            and there is no breath in them.
         51:18 They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their
            visitation they shall perish.
         51:19 The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of
            all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of
            hosts is his name.
         51:20 Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I
            break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;
            51:21 And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;
               and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;
            51:22 With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with
               thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I
               break in pieces the young man and the maid; 51:23 I will also
               break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with
               thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen;
               and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.
         51:24 And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of
            Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight,
            saith the LORD.
         51:25 Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the
            LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine
            hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make
            thee a burnt mountain.
         51:26 And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a
            stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith
            the LORD.
         51:27 Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the
            nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her
            the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain
            against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.
         51:28 Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the
            captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of
            his dominion.
         51:29 And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the
            LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of
            Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.
         51:30 The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have
            remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as
            women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.
         51:31 One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet
            another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one
            end, 51:32 And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they
            have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
         51:33 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The
            daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh
            her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.
         51:34 Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath
            crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me
            up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he
            hath cast me out.
         51:35 The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall
            the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of
            Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
         51:36 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause,
            and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make
            her springs dry.
         51:37 And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an
            astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.
         51:38 They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions'
            whelps.
         51:39 In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them
            drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and
            not wake, saith the LORD.
         51:40 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams
            with he goats.
         51:41 How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth
            surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
            51:42 The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the
               multitude of the waves thereof.
         51:43 Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a
            land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass
            thereby.
         51:44 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of
            his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall
            not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall
            fall.
         51:45 My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every
            man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.
         51:46 And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall
            be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after
            that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land,
            ruler against ruler.
         51:47 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon
            the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be
            confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
         51:48 Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall
            sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the
            north, saith the LORD.
         51:49 As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at
            Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.
         51:50 Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still:
            remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
         51:51 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath
            covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of
            the LORD's house.
         51:52 Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do
            judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the
            wounded shall groan.
         51:53 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should
            fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come
            unto her, saith the LORD.
         51:54 A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from
            the land of the Chaldeans: 51:55 Because the LORD hath spoiled
            Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves
            do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered: 51:56
            Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her
            mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the
            LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.
         51:57 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her
            captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep
            a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the
            LORD of hosts.
         51:58 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall
            be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire;
            and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and
            they shall be weary.
         51:59 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of
            Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of
            Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this
            Seraiah was a quiet prince.
         51:60 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon
            Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.
         51:61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and
            shalt see, and shalt read all these words; 51:62 Then shalt thou
            say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off,
            that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it
            shall be desolate for ever.
         51:63 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this
            book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the
            midst of Euphrates: 51:64 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon
            sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her:
            and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
      Psalms 51:
         Found This by accident
         51:1 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
            according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
            transgressions.
         51:2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
         51:3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before
            me.
         51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
            sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be
            clear when thou judgest.
         51:5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
            conceive me.
         51:6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
            hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
         51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall
            be whiter than snow.
         51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast
            broken may rejoice.
         51:9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
         51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
            within me.
         51:11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit
            from me.
         51:12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy
            free spirit.
         51:13 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
            converted unto thee.
         51:14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
            salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
         51:15 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
            praise.
         51:16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
            delightest not in burnt offering.
         51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
            contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
         51:18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of
            Jerusalem.
         51:19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,
            with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer
            bullocks upon thine altar.
      Found this at a Grave Yard in Hoskins:
         I was lead by a small voice to drive to Hoskins NE, through town to a
         graveyard south of town, to a grave stome which had the inscription:
         ‘To Me, Life is in Christ, Death is in Cain’.

       UFOs:
          • The human mind fills in the blanks.  If we see something that we
          cannot readily identify, our mind will complete the picture from
          things that we have seen before.  We have all seen UFOs in movies,
          therefore our minds will fill in the blanks.  They are in fact
          fallen angels and demons or demon possessed humans.

          Psalms for Sexual Healing:
             • Here are the Psalms traditionally recited aloud.  We have found that
               they really cleanse the soul after sexual defilement or self-abuse.
               These Psalms are also excellent for keeping away sexually tormenting
               spirits.

          thou shalt be saved, and thy house.

          Romans 3:12  There is none that doeth good, no, not one.

          Romans 10:9  if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,

                sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
             23 ¶ Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you,
                That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of
                heaven.
             24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go
                through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter
                into the kingdom of God.
             25 When his disciples heard [it], they were exceedingly amazed,
                saying, Who then can be saved?
             26 But Jesus beheld [them], and said unto them, With men this is
                impossible; but with God all things are possible.

          Read Exodus:14:11-31         Isaiah 19:4
             God lead Israel into a trap.  Between Pharaoh and the Red Sea,

             was one way GOD.
             It is through GOD’s grace that I can be saved.  I was lead into
             a trap, if I would have submitted to GOD, I could have prevailed.
             I didn’t.  Pride proceeds the fall.
          How do we sin:
             First John 2:
             16 For all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and
                the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the
                Father, but is of the world.
          Proverbs 26:
             11 As a dog returneth to his vomit, [so] a fool returneth to his
                folly.
             12 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? [there is] more
                hope of a fool than of him.
             14 [As] the door turneth upon his hinges, so [doth] the slothful
                upon his bed.
             15 The slothful hideth his hand in [his] bosom; it grieveth him
                to bring it again to his mouth.
             16 The sluggard [is] wiser in his own conceit than seven men
                that can render a reason.
             17 He that passeth by, [and] meddleth with strife [belonging]
                not to him, [is like] one that taketh a dog by the ears.
          Psalm 23:
             1 The LORD [is] my shepherd; I shall not want.
             2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me
               beside the still waters.
             3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of
               righteousness for his name's sake.
             4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
               I will fear no evil: for thou [art] with me; thy rod and thy
               staff they comfort me.
             5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
               enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
             6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
               life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
   On 11Nov12:
       Things that are good in the sight of the Lord:
          Romans 12:1-21
          Romans:
             CHAPTER 14
             1 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not to
               doubtful disputations.
             2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is
               weak, eateth herbs.
             3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let
               not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath
               received him.
             4 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own
               master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for
               God is able to make him stand.
             5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth
               every day [alike]. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own
               mind.
             6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth [it] unto the Lord; and
               he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard
               [it]. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God
               thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and
               giveth God thanks.
             7 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
             8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we
               die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die,
               we are the Lord's.
             9 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that
               he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
             10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at
                nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the
                judgment seat of Christ.
             11 For it is written, [As] I live, saith the Lord, every knee
                shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
             12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
             13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge
                this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion
                to fall in [his] brother's way.
             14 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that [there is]
                nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any
                thing to be unclean, to him [it is] unclean.
             15 But if thy brother be grieved with [thy] meat, now walkest
                thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom
                Christ died.
             16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
             17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but
                righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
             18 For he that in these things serveth Christ [is] acceptable to
                God, and approved of men.
             19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for
                peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
             20 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed [are]
                pure; but [it is] evil for that man who eateth with offence.
             21 [It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor
                [any thing] whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or
                is made weak.
             22 Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Happy [is]
                he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he
                alloweth.
             23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth]
                not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin.

       Proverbs 26:
          11 As a dog returneth to his vomit, [so] a fool returneth to his
             folly.
       Psalms 23:
          4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
            will fear no evil: for thou [art] with me; thy rod and thy staff
            they comfort me.
             • The valley of the shadow of death is the world and sin
             • The Rod is the Old Testament
             • The Staff is the New Testament
       Matthew 12:
          43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
             dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.
          44 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
             out; and when he is come, he findeth [it] empty, swept, and
             garnished.
          45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more
             wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the
             last [state] of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall
             it be also unto this wicked generation.
       Note:
          This is about how powerful addiction can be, once you are able to
          cast out an unclean spirit you must replace it with a clean one
          (Holy Ghost).  This is true for me and my sexual perversion.

   On 15Nov12:
      If Jesus sets us free from the law why did he say this?
       Matthew 5:
       16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
          works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
       17 ¶ Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I
          am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
       18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
          one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
          fulfilled.
       19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
          and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom
          of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach [them], the same shall
          be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
      The Answer:
       This is the difference between true righteousness and self
       righteousness.  It must be seen in the fullness of the Sermon on the
       Mount.  The Sermon on the Mount is a deeper understanding of the law,
       the difference between the letter of the law and the meaning of the
       law.  We as Christians should follow the meaning of the law with all
       our heart and soul.  Seeking to perfect ourselves through Jesus.
       Without Jesus we are incapable of understanding or following even the
       letter of the law.
       Matthew 5:
       3 Blessed [are] the poor in spirit: for their's is the kingdom of
         heaven.
       4 Blessed [are] they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
       5 Blessed [are] the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
       6 Blessed [are] they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness:
         for they shall be filled.
       7 Blessed [are] the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
       8 Blessed [are] the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
       9 Blessed [are] the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children
         of God.
       10 Blessed [are] they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake:
          for their's is the kingdom of heaven.
       Roman 8:
       1 [There is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
         Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
       2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free
         from the law of sin and death.
       3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,
         God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
         condemned sin in the flesh:
       4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk
         not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
      Changing the word of GOD:
         Luke 8:
          11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
          12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil,
             and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should
             believe and be saved.
          13 They on the rock [are they], which, when they hear, receive the
             word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while
             believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
          14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have
             heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and
             pleasures of [this] life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
          15 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and
             good heart, having heard the word, keep [it], and bring forth
             fruit with patience.
         Luke 11:
          28 But he said, Yea rather, blessed [are] they that hear the word
             of God, and keep it.
         Mark 4:
          15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but
             when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away
             the word that was sown in their hearts.
         Revelation 3:
          8 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door,
            and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast
            kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
          9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say
            they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them
            to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have
            loved thee.
          10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep
             thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the
             world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.
         Revelation 22:
          18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
             prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things,
             God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this
             book:
          19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of
             this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of
             life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which are
             written in this book.
         2 Timothy 3:
          15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which
             are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is
             in Christ Jesus.
          16 All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is]
             profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
             instruction in righteousness:
         Deuteronomy 4:
          19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of
             this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of
             life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which are
             written in this book.

      A Girl's Message To All Christians iEmanuella's Channel:
      http://www.youtube.com/user/iEmanuella Hey there! I'm Emanuella. I'm
      a Christian. I have been a "good" Christian most of my life. It was
      my identity. I used to like to tell people how "good" I was, how I
      kept all the Commandments. I thought that was "Good"......

      Then I realized something...I Failed!!! "Christian" was just a name
      I wore...kind of like a pretty coat over a dirty body...It didn't
      match my heart. Here's why:

      If you were an Atheist or Agnostic or anything else...And if you
      didn't agree with me...I would disdain you as a person. I feel like
      a hypocrite! I feel disgusting! And I can't take it anymore! I
      wasn't interested in being your "Friend". I just wanted to change
      you. I thought that was my job.

      Christianity is about being like "Christ". Jesus loved everyone,
      First. If they didn't accept what He said, He still loved them. Its
      not my job to change you, I can't. But its my job to love you. That
      I can.

      So this is an appeal to my Christian Brothers and Sisters, not all
      but some... stop the Damnation. Stop the Judgement. Stop the
      Religism. Thats not our business.

      It doesn't matter how well you can preach...How many Bible Verses
      you've memorized or How many people "think" you are all that. If you
      don't have love, you're nothing. Love is not a chore. Its a
      revelation. The Christ you serve revealed it in its purest form.

      Gandhi said: "I like your Christ, but I do not like your
      Christians."

      Don't be one of "those". This is an invitation....  Start the
      LOVE...Join the movement...
         Note:
            To me this is the truth.  It is impossible for us to change
            ourselves, how is it possible to change someone else?  The answer
            is ‘it is not’.  So often we do Satan’s job for it, Satan means
            ‘the opposer, adversary or accuser’, we are a stumblingblock to
            people we are trying to save.  We should be the messanger of the
            gospel, and follow the commandments of Jesus, love without
            reservation, love your neighbour and enemies as yourself.  It
            doesn’t matter if they are gay or strait, drunk or sober, or
            saint or sinner.  It is not our job to judge or accuse.

            Love is unconditional, a free gift that does not judge.  Harlot
            love is conditional, if you do this or give me that, I will love
            you, if not I will hate you.  Which kind of love do you give?

            It will be unconditional love that sends the true message and
            will allow the seed of the gospel to be planted in fertile
            ground, not to the wayside, thorns, or rocks.
         Love concerning your neighbour and enemies:
            I Corinthians 4:
            21 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love,
               and [in] the spirit of meekness?
            I John 3:
            11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that
               we should love one another.
            16 Hereby perceive we the love [of God], because he laid down his
               life for us: and we ought to lay down [our] lives for the
               brethren.
            23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the
               name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave
               us commandment.
            I John 4:
            7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every
               one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
            8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
            9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that
               God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might
               live through him.
            10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,
               and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins.
            11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one
               another.
            12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God
               dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
            18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
               because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect
               in love.
            19 We love him, because he first loved us.
            20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a
               liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen,
               how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
            I Peter 1:
            22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth
               through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, [see
               that ye] love one another with a pure heart fervently:
            I Peter 3:
            8 Finally, [be ye] all of one mind, having compassion one of
               another, love as brethren, [be] pitiful, [be] courteous:
            John 13:
            34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another;
               as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
            Luke 6:
            33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank
               have ye? for sinners also do even the same.
            34 And if ye lend [to them] of whom ye hope to receive, what
               thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as
               much again.
            35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for
               nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be
               the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the
               unthankful and [to] the evil.
            36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
            37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye
               shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:
            Matthew 5:
            43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
               neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
            44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
               you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
               despitefully use you, and persecute you;
      Lucifer exalting itself:
         Isaiah 14:
         12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!
            [how] art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the
            nations!
         13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I
            will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon
            the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
         14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the
            most High.
         15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
         16 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, [and] consider
            thee, [saying, Is] this the man that made the earth to tremble,
            that did shake kingdoms;
         17 [That] made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities
            thereof; [that] opened not the house of his prisoners?
         18 All the kings of the nations, [even] all of them, lie in glory,
            every one in his own house.
         19 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,
            [and as] the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with
            a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase
            trodden under feet.
         20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast
            destroyed thy land, [and] slain thy people: the seed of evildoers
            shall never be renowned.

         Leonid Meteor Shower:
            After a days-long lead-up, today, November 17, 2012, is finally the peak
            of the Leonid Meteor Shower, which means that tonight, more so than any
            before or after, should offer the most streaking through the sky.

            Every November, Earth passes through the stretch of space junk shed by
            Comet Tempel-Tuttle, reaching the deepest concentration of debris tonight.
            According to some estimates, under ideal conditions (dark country skies),
            one can expect to see 20-30 meteors per hour. The reason the meteors are
            called Leonids is because the meteors seem to radiate from the
            constellation Leo. The best time to view the shower is in the pre-dawn
            hours, with 3-6am being best.
         Pray for Isreal:
            Psalms 122:
            1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.
            2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
            3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
            4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of
            Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.
            5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of
            David.
            6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
            7 Peace be within thy walls, [and] prosperity within thy palaces.
            8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace [be] within
            thee.
            9 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
   On 18Nov12:
      Last night had some disturbing dreams, about Multiple Personality
      disorder, and sins of my father against me.  It was in a place of desolation.
      Today I am being buffeted with thoughts of sexual perversion.  Time to
      read Psalms and scripture.
      The Penitential Psalms:
         These psalms mt be used as your own prayers when you want to confess
         sin and ask for GOD’s forgiveness. 1John 1:9
            9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
            [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
         PSALM 6:
         PSALM 32:
         PSALM 38:
         PSALM 51:
         PSALM 102:
         PSALM 130:
         PSALM 143:
      Good thoughts for bad times:
      PSALM 12:
         1 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from
         among the children of men.
         2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: [with] flattering
         lips [and] with a double heart do they speak.
         3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, [and] the tongue that
         speaketh proud things:
         4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips [are] our
         own: who [is] lord over us?
         5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now
         will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set [him] in safety [from him
         that] puffeth at him.
         6 The words of the LORD [are] pure words: [as] silver tried in a
         furnace of earth, purified seven times.
         7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this
         generation for ever.
         8 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
      A prayer for help:
      PSALM 28:
         1 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, [if]
         thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
         2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift
         up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
         3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity,
         which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief [is] in their
         hearts.
         4 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness
         of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render
         to them their desert.
         5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of
         his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.
         6 Blessed [be] the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
         supplications.
         7 The LORD [is] my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and
         I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song
         will I praise him.
         8 The LORD [is] their strength, and he [is] the saving strength of his
         anointed.
         9 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and
         lift them up for ever.
      The purpose of man:
      Ecclesiastes 12:
         12 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books
            [there is] no end; and much study [is] a weariness of the flesh.
         13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep
            his commandments: for this [is] the whole [duty] of man.
         14 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret
            thing, whether [it be] good, or whether [it be] evil.
   On 19Nov12:
      Woke and the answer to the question “If Jesus sets us free from the law
      why did he say this? Matthew 5”.  When Jesus was taking about the law we
      was taking about himself.  Shall not break any of the laws not one jot or
      tiddle.
      Study Galilaeans, the bible will give the answers:
         Galatians 2:
            3 But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled
            to be circumcised:
            4 And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came
            in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus,
            that they might bring us into bondage:
      Israel:
         http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/19/obama-urges-ceasefire-israel-gaza
         CNN reported that three US warships in the Atlantic that had been
         scheduled to arrive in Virginia just after Thanksgiving have been
         redeployed to the eastern Mediterranean. CNN quoted US officials saying
         although evacuation remained a remote possibility, such contingency plans
         had to be put in place.

         "This is due diligence. It is better to be prepared should there be a need,"
         an official said, adding they would have no combat role. The ships are the
         USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York and the USS Gunston Hall.
            ‘They say the ships have no combat role’, but each ship have up to 2000
            Marines and support equipement.
         White House spokesman Jay Carney said of the Obama and Morsi talks: "The two
         leaders discussed ways to de-escalate the situation in Gaza, and president
         Obama underscored the necessity of Hamas ending rocket fire into Israel.
         President Obama also offered condolences for the terrible loss of life in the
         recent train accident in Egypt."
         Psalm 121:
            1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
            2 My help [cometh] from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.
            3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will
            not slumber.
            4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
            5 The LORD [is] thy keeper: the LORD [is] thy shade upon thy right
            hand.
            6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
            7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy
            soul.
            8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this
            time forth, and even for evermore.
      Born Again:
      It is not just one act, walk in righteousness ever after.  Regeneration is
      a secret act of the Holy Spirit, a work of God to change a sinful heart.
      You cannot change yourself.  The character of God becomes manifest in the
      sinner.  If you do sin, confess and repent, if say we do not sin then we,
      are liars.  If you are sensitive to sin in your life, it is the mark of
      the regenerated heart.  If you fight against the sin in your life.  Deny
      your former life, hate it.  Take up the cross daily.
      Matthew Chapter 7:
         21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
            kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
            heaven.
         22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
            thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done
            many wonderful works?
         23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye
            that work iniquity.
      Luke 6:
         46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
         47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will
            shew you to whom he is like:
         48 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the
            foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat
            vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded
            upon a rock.
         49 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a
            foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did
            beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house
            was great.
      Titus 1:
         16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny [him], being
            abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
      I John 2:
         Charactristics of GOD:
            Is Light Holy:
            5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto
            you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
            Is Righteousness:
            7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness
            is righteous, even as he is righteous.
            Is Love:
            7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one
            that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
            Is True:
            20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
               understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him
               that is true, [even] in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God,
               and eternal life.
         4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar,
         and the truth is not in him.
         9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness
         even until now.
         29 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth
            righteousness is born of him.
      II Peter 1:
         1 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have
         obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God
         and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
         2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and
         of Jesus our Lord,
         3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that
         [pertain] unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that
         hath called us to glory and virtue:
         4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by
         these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the
         corruption that is in the world through lust.
         5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to
         virtue knowledge;
         6 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience
         godliness;
         7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
         8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make [you that ye shall]
         neither [be] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
         Christ.
         9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and
         hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
         10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and
            election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:

      Israel Issues:
         (Reuters) - A man apparently suffering from mental health problems
         stabbed a security guard at the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv on Tuesday and
         was apprehended, police said.

         "A Mazda car stopped next to the U.S. embassy and a man got out
         carrying a red bag and a pitchfork," said David Cohen, 48, who told
         Reuters he witnessed the incident while jogging along Tel Aviv's
         Mediterranean promenade.

         "He began to run toward the security guards. They saw him, took their
         guns out and told him to get down on the ground," Cohen said.

         "He continued running and then they fired in the air and ordered him
         again to lie down. He continued to advance. They jumped on him and took
         his bag away."

         Police said one of the guards was slightly wounded and the attacker was
         taken into custody.

         "It appears he was mentally unbalanced," Tel Aviv police chief Yoram
         Ohayon told reporters.

         Israel Radio said the assailant was a 41-year-old Israeli with a
         criminal record.

         Demon Possesion:
            Could this guy be demon possessed.  This kind of attack could have
            been symbolic.
      If we fall into sin:

            1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.
            And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
            the righteous:
            2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but
            also for [the sins of] the whole world.

               the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the
               world.
         I John 3:
            3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as
         I John 4:
            10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
               sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins.  he is pure.

         Matthew 6:
          1 Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be
            tempted of the devil.
          2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward
            an hungred.
          3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of
            God, command that these stones be made bread.
          4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread
            alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
          5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on
            a pinnacle of the temple,
          6 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down:
            for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee:
            and in [their] hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou
            dash thy foot against a stone.
          7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the
            Lord thy God.
          8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and
            sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
          9 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt
            fall down and worship me.
          10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
             written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt
             thou serve.
          11 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered
             unto him.
         Genesis 1:
          28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
             multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion
             over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
             every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
         Genesis 9:
          2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast
            of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth

            are they delivered.
         Ephesians 6:
          11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
             against the wiles of the devil.
          12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
             principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness
             of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high [places].
          13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be
             able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
          14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
             having on the breastplate of righteousness;
          15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
         Daniel 5:
          3 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
            another.
          4 The first [was] like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till
            the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth,
            and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given
            to it.
          5 And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up
            itself on one side, and [it had] three ribs in the mouth of it
            between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour
            much flesh.
          6 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon
            the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads;
            and dominion was given to it.
          7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,
            dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron
            teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with
            the feet of it: and it [was] diverse from all the beasts that [were]
            before it; and it had ten horns.

           • verse 11, 12 (Beasts)
          1 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? [why art thou so] far
            from helping me, [and from] the words of my roaring?
          2 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the
            night season, and am not silent.
          3 But thou [art] holy, [O thou] that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
          4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver
            them.
          5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and
            were not confounded.
          6 But I [am] a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of
            the people.
          7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they
            shake the head, [saying],
          8 He trusted on the LORD [that] he would deliver him: let him deliver
            him, seeing he delighted in him.
          9 But thou [art] he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me

          10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou [art] my God from my
             mother's belly.
          11 Be not far from me; for trouble [is] near; for [there is] none to
             help.
          12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong [bulls] of Bashan have beset
             me round.
          13 They gaped upon me [with] their mouths, [as] a ravening and a
             roaring lion.
          14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my
             heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
          15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to
             my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
          16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have
             inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
          17 I may tell all my bones: they look [and] stare upon me.

          20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the
             dog.
          21 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the
             horns of the unicorns.
          22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
             congregation will I praise thee.

             unto him, he heard.

             that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

            dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
         14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
            I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

      SARS in Middle East:
         Is a New SARS-like Virus Spreading in the Middle East?

         As with most emerging epidemics, we usually ignore them until people
         start dying. If the same logic applies here, it’s time to begin paying
         attention to the new SARS-like virus found in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
         While only six cases have been identified so far, two of the patients
         died, suggesting that the survival rate isn’t stellar.

         According to Reuters, the World Health Organization (WHO) originally
         issued an international alert in late September saying a virus
         previously unknown in humans had infected a Qatari man who had
         recently been in Saudi Arabia, where another man with the same virus
         had died.

         On Friday, November 23, the WHO said in an outbreak update that it had
         registered four more cases and one of the new patients had died.

         “The additional cases have been identified as part of the enhanced
         surveillance in Saudi Arabia (3 cases, including 1 death) and Qatar (1
         case),” the WHO statement said.

         The new virus is a coronavirus with similar symptoms to SARS (Severe
         Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which emerged in China in 2002 and killed
         around a 10th of the 8,000 people it infected worldwide. Typical
         symptoms include coughing, difficulty breathing and high fever.  It
         spreads like other respiratory viruses, through releasing viral
         particles from coughing and sneezing which then find new hosts in the
         general vicinity.

         The WHO said investigations were being conducted into the likely
         source of the infection, the method of exposure, and the possibility
         of human-to-human transmission of the virus.

         “Close contacts of the recently confirmed cases are being identified
         and followed-up,” it said.

         It added that so far, only the two most recently confirmed cases in
         Saudi Arabia were epidemiologically linked — they were from the same
         family, living in the same household.

         “Preliminary investigations indicate that these two cases presented
         with similar symptoms of illness. One died and the other recovered,”
         the WHO’s statement said. (Source: Reuters Health)

         Grounds for alarm?  No, but there’s enough information coming out now
         that paying attention is warranted.

       News:
         Fifth coronavirus death reported

         By James Gallagher Health and science reporter, BBC News

         The source of the virus is uncertain Continue reading the main story

         New deadly virus may be 'bat bug' How threatening is the new
         coronavirus?  New 'Sars-like' virus identified A fifth person has died
         from a new respiratory illness similar to the Sars virus, according to
         the World Health Organization.

         The WHO said the two latest deaths were in Jordan. The disease had
         previously been detected only in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, although one
         patient was transferred to the UK for treatment.

         It brings the total number of cases of the infection to nine.

         There may also be evidence of human to human spread of the virus.

         It causes pneumonia and sometimes kidney failure.

         There was a series of severe cases of pneumonia in Jordan earlier in
         the year.  However, the novel coronavirus had not been discovered at
         the time so did not appear in routine tests.

         Two of the deaths in April have now been confirmed as being part of
         the outbreak.

         Sars-like Coronaviruses are a group of viruses ranging from the common
         cold to the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus. They
         infect a wide range of animals.

         In 2002 an outbreak of Sars killed about 800 people after the virus
         spread to more than 30 countries around the world.

         The WHO is still trying to work out where the infection came from.
         Studies show that the virus is closely related to one found in some
         species of bats.

         How readily the virus spreads will be important for assessing how
         great a threat it poses.

         The WHO said that, unlike Sars, the new coronavirus, "does not appear
         to transmit easily between people".

         However, it warns that two clusters in Saudi Arabia and Jordan, "raise
         the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission" or they could
         have been exposed to the same source of the infection.

        chaos (n.)
            mid-15c., "gaping void," from L. chaos, from Gk. khaos "abyss, that
            which gapes wide open, is vast and empty," from *khnwos, from PIE
            root *gheu, *gh(e)i "to gape" (cf. Gk khaino "I yawn," O.E.
            ginian, O.N. ginnunga-gap; see yawn).

            Meaning "utter confusion" (c.1600) is extended from theological use
            of chaos for "the void at the beginning of creation" in Vulgate
            version of Genesis. The Greek for "disorder" was tarakhe, however
            the use of chaos here was rooted in Hesiod ("Theogony"), who
            describes khaos as the primeval emptiness of the Universe, begetter
            of Erebus and Nyx ("Night"), and in Ovid ("Metamorphoses"), who
            opposes Khaos to Kosmos, "the ordered Universe." Chaos theory in
            the modern mathematical sense is attested from c.1977.

            Note:  I am not the judge but this video is truly disturbing, it is
            indicative of today’s wickedness.  I can see that the police of today
            have to deal with a large amount of stress.  And they have real fears
            but there is no excuss for what is in the video.
            Psalm 58:
               1 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
                 uprightly, O ye sons of men?
               2 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of
                 your hands in the earth.
               3 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon
                 as they be born, speaking lies.
               4 Their poison [is] like the poison of a serpent: [they are]
                 like the deaf adder [that] stoppeth her ear;
               5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming
                 never so wisely.
               6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great
                 teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
               7 Let them melt away as waters [which] run continually: [when]
                 he bendeth [his bow to shoot] his arrows, let them be as cut
                 in pieces.
               8 As a snail [which] melteth, let [every one of them] pass away:
                 [like] the untimely birth of a woman, [that] they may not see
                 the sun.
               9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away
                 as with a whirlwind, both living, and in [his] wrath.
               10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he
                  shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
               11 So that a man shall say, Verily [there is] a reward for the
                  righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

      HABAKKUK 1:
      1 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
      2 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! [even] cry out
        unto thee [of] violence, and thou wilt not save!
      3 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause [me] to behold grievance? for
        spoiling and violence [are] before me: and there are [that] raise up
        strife and contention.
      4 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the
        wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment
        proceedeth.
      5 ¶ Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for
        [I] will work a work in your days, [which] ye will not believe, though
        it be told [you].
      6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, [that] bitter and hasty nation,
        which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the
        dwellingplaces [that are] not their's.
      7 They [are] terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity
        shall proceed of themselves.
      8 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce
        than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves,
        and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle
        [that] hasteth to eat.
      9 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up [as] the
        east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.
      10 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn
         unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap
         dust, and take it.
      11 Then shall [his] mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend,
         [imputing] this his power unto his god.
      12 ¶ [Art] thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we
         shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O
         mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.
      13 [Thou art] of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on
         iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously,
         [and] holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth [the man that is]
         more righteous than he?
      14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, [that
         have] no ruler over them?
      15 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net,
         and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are
         glad.
      16 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their
         drag; because by them their portion [is] fat, and their meat
         plenteous.
      17 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to
         slay the nations?

      thousand, or the sands of the sea shore.
      Matthew 7:
         24 ¶ Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
            them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon
            a rock:
         25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew,
            and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon
            a rock.
         26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them
            not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house
            upon the sand:
         27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew,
            and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of
            it.
         Note: In this verse Jesus is taking about building a strong house
         (church) on ONE rock, not on many rocks (sand)  If you doctine is
         built on the Bible it will be a strong foundation, but if it is built
         on many books and opinions it will be a weak foundation.
      PSALM 3:
      A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
         1 LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many [are] they that
           rise up against me.
         2 Many [there be] which say of my soul, [There is] no help for him in
           God. Selah.
         3 But thou, O LORD, [art] a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up
           of mine head.
         4 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy
           hill. Selah.
         5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
         6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set
           [themselves] against me round about.
         7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine
           enemies [upon] the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the
           ungodly.
         8 Salvation [belongeth] unto the LORD: thy blessing [is] upon thy
           people. Selah.
      PSALM 91
         1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide
           under the shadow of the Almighty.
         2 I will say of the LORD, [He is] my refuge and my fortress: my God;
           in him will I trust.
         3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, [and]
           from the noisome pestilence.
         4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt
           thou trust: his truth [shall be thy] shield and buckler.
         5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; [nor] for the
           arrow [that] flieth by day;
         6 [Nor] for the pestilence [that] walketh in darkness; [nor] for the
           destruction [that] wasteth at noonday.
         7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right
           hand; [but] it shall not come nigh thee.
         8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
           wicked.
         9 Because thou hast made the LORD, [which is] my refuge, [even] the
           most High, thy habitation;
         10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh
            thy dwelling.
         11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all
            thy ways.
         12 They shall bear thee up in [their] hands, lest thou dash thy foot
            against a stone.
         13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
            dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
         14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
            I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
         15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I [will be] with him
            in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
         16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

      SALVATION FROM HELL:
        Romans 1:
            15 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
               that are at Rome also.
            16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power
               of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew
               first, and also to the Greek.
            17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
               faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
            18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
               ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
               unrighteousness;
            19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God
               hath shewed [it] unto them.
            20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
               clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even]
               his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
            21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God,
               neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and
               their foolish heart was darkened.
            22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
            23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made
               like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and
               creeping things.
            24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of
               their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
            25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served
               the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
            26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even
               their women did change the natural use into that which is against
               nature:
            27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman,
               burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that
               which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of
               their error which was meet.
            28 And even as they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge,
               God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which
               are not convenient;
            29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness,
               covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,
               malignity; whisperers,
            30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors
               of evil things, disobedient to parents,
            31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection,
               implacable, unmerciful:
            32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things
               are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in
               them that do them.
        Romans 2:
            1 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
            judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself;
            for thou that judgest doest the same things.
            2 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
            against them which commit such things.
            3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such
            things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of
            God?
            4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and
            longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
            repentance?
            5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto
            thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the
            righteous judgment of God;
            6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
            7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and
            honour and immortality, eternal life:
            8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but
            obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
            9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of
            the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
            10 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to
               the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
            11 For there is no respect of persons with God.
            12 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without
               law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the
               law;
            13 (For not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but the
               doers of the law shall be justified.
            14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
               things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law
               unto themselves:
            15 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their
               conscience also bearing witness, and [their] thoughts the mean
               while accusing or else excusing one another;)
            16 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
               according to my gospel.
            17 Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest
               thy boast of God,
            18 And knowest [his] will, and approvest the things that are more
               excellent, being instructed out of the law;
            19 And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a
               light of them which are in darkness,
            20 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the
               form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
            21 Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?
               thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
            22 Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit
               adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
            23 Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law
               dishonourest thou God?
            24 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you,
               as it is written.
            25 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if
               thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made
               uncircumcision.
            26 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law,
               shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
            27 And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the
               law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress
               the law?
            28 For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither [is that]
               circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
            29 But he [is] a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision [is
               that] of the heart, in the spirit, [and] not in the letter; whose
               praise [is] not of men, but of God.
        Romans 3:
            1 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit [is there] of
            circumcision?
            2 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the
            oracles of God.
            3 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the
            faith of God without effect?
            4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is
            written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and
            mightest overcome when thou art judged.
            5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what
            shall we say? [Is] God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as
            a man)
            6 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
            7 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his
            glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
            8 And not [rather], (as we be slanderously reported, and as some
            affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose
            damnation is just.
            9 What then? are we better [than they]? No, in no wise: for we have
            before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
            10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
            11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after
               God.
            12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
               unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
            13 Their throat [is] an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have
               used deceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips:
            14 Whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness:
            15 Their feet [are] swift to shed blood:
            16 Destruction and misery [are] in their ways:
            17 And the way of peace have they not known:
            18 There is no fear of God before their eyes.
            19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them
               who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the
               world may become guilty before God.
            20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified
               in his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin.
            21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
               being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
            22 Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ
               unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no
               difference:
            23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
            24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is
               in Christ Jesus:
            25 Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his
               blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that
               are past, through the forbearance of God;
            26 To declare, [I say], at this time his righteousness: that he might
               be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
            27 Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?
               Nay: but by the law of faith.
            28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the
               deeds of the law.
            29 [Is he] the God of the Jews only? [is he] not also of the Gentiles?
               Yes, of the Gentiles also:
            30 Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by
               faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
            31 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we
               establish the law.
        Romans 4:
            1 What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the
            flesh, hath found?
            2 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath [whereof] to glory;
            but not before God.
            3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
            counted unto him for righteousness.
            4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of
            debt.
            5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth
            the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
            6 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom
            God imputeth righteousness without works,
            7 [Saying], Blessed [are] they whose iniquities are forgiven, and
            whose sins are covered.
            8 Blessed [is] the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
            9 [Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only], or upon
            the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to
            Abraham for righteousness.
            10 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
               uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
            11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
               righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised:
               that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they
               be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them
               also:
            12 And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the
               circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of
               our father Abraham, which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised.
            13 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not
               to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the
               righteousness of faith.
            14 For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void,
               and the promise made of none effect:
            15 Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, [there is] no
               transgression.
            16 Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end
               the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which
               is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham;
               who is the father of us all,
            17 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,)
               before him whom he believed, [even] God, who quickeneth the dead,
               and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
            18 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father
               of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy
               seed be.
            19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now
               dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the
               deadness of Sara's womb:
            20 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was
               strong in faith, giving glory to God;
            21 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able
               also to perform.
            22 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
            23 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to
               him;
            24 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him
               that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
            25 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our
               justification.
        Hebrews 9:
            27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the
               judgment:
            28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto
               them that look for him shall he appear the second time without
               sin unto salvation.
        Revelation 20:
            11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
               whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was
               found no place for them.
            12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the
               books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the
               book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things
               which were written in the books, according to their works.
            13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and
               hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were
               judged every man according to their works.
            14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the
               second death.
            15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
               into the lake of fire.
        John 8:
            48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that
               judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge
               him in the last day.
            49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,
               he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should
               speak.
            50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever
               I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.

         John 3:
            19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
               and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds
               were evil.
            20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh
               to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
            21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may
               be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
         John 8:
            43 Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye cannot
               hear my word.
            44 Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father
               ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not
               in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh
               a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father
               of it.
            45 And because I tell [you] the truth, ye believe me not.
            46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why
               do ye not believe me?
            47 He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear [them]
               not, because ye are not of God.
            48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that
               thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?

               ye do dishonour me.

         Luke 16:
            19 ¶ There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and
               fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
            20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at
               his gate, full of sores,
            21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich
               man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
            22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
               the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was
               buried;
            23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
               Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
            24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
               send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,
               and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
         James 3:
            1 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive
              the greater condemnation.
            2 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word,
              the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to bridle the whole
              body.
            3 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us;
              and we turn about their whole body.
            4 Behold also the ships, which though [they be] so great, and [are]
              driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very
              small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
            5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.
              Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
            6 And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue
              among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth
              on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
            7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of
              things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
            8 But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil, full of
              deadly poison.
            9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we
              men, which are made after the similitude of God.
            10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
               brethren, these things ought not so to be.
         Revelation 20:
            12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the
               books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the
               book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things
               which were written in the books, according to their works.
         Revelation 21:

              murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and
              all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
              fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

      Daniel 4:
         28 ¶ All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
         29 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of
            Babylon.
         30 The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built
            for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the
            honour of my majesty?
         31 While the word [was] in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from
            heaven, [saying], O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The
            kingdom is departed from thee.
         32 And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling [shall be] with
            the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen,
            and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most
            High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he
            will.
         33 The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was
            driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with
            the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' [feathers],
            and his nails like birds' [claws].
         34 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto
            heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the
            most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose
            dominion [is] an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom [is] from
            generation to generation:
         35 And all the inhabitants of the earth [are] reputed as nothing: and he
            doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and [among] the
            inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him,
            What doest thou?
         36 At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my
            kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my
            counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my
            kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.
         37 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven,
            all whose works [are] truth, and his ways judgment: and those that
            walk in pride he is able to abase.
      Verse 33 is interesting:
         33 The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was
            driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with
            the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' [feathers],
            and his nails like birds' [claws].
      Note:
            I have been noticing ‘eagles’ in scripture and in current events.  It
            seems to me that any countries that are against Isreal have eagles in

         3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word
           of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which
           do appear.
         4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain,
           by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying
           of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
         5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was
           not found, because God had translated him: for before his
           translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
         6 But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that
           cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder
           of them that diligently seek him.
         7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved
           with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which
           he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which
           is by faith.
         8 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he
           should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out,
           not knowing whither he went.
         9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a strange
           country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs
           with him of the same promise:
         10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and
            maker [is] God.
         11 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed,
            and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she
            judged him faithful who had promised.
         12 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, [so
            many] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which
            is by the sea shore innumerable.
         13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
            having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and
            embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and
            pilgrims on the earth.
         14 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
            country.
         15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from whence
            they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
         16 But now they desire a better [country], that is, an heavenly:
            wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath
            prepared for them a city.
         17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that
            had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],
         18 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
         19 Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, even from the
            dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.
         20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
         21 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
            Joseph; and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff.
         22 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the
            children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
         23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his
            parents, because they saw [he was] a proper child; and they were
            not afraid of the king's commandment.
         24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the
            son of Pharaoh's daughter;
         25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than
            to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
         26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures
            in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
         27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for
            he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
         28 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood,
            lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
         29 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land]: which
            the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
         30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed
            about seven days.
         31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not,
            when she had received the spies with peace.
         32 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of
            Gedeon, and [of] Barak, and [of] Samson, and [of] Jephthae; [of]
            David also, and Samuel, and [of] the prophets:
         33 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained
            promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
         34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out
            of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to
            flight the armies of the aliens.
         35 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were
            tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a
            better resurrection:
         36 And others had trial of [cruel] mockings and scourgings, yea,
            moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
         37 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain
            with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins;
            being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
         38 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and
            [in] mountains, and [in] dens and caves of the earth.
         39 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,
            received not the promise:
         40 God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us
            should not be made perfect.
   The defences of the faith:
     II Timothy 3:
         1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
         2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters,
           proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
         3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers,
           incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
         4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
           God;
         5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such
           turn away.
         6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive
           silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
         7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
         8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist
           the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
         9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest
           unto all [men], as their's also was.
         10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,
            faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,
         11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at
            Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of [them]
            all the Lord delivered me.
         12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
            persecution.
         13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and
            being deceived.
         14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast
            been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned [them];
         15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which
            are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in
            Christ Jesus.
         16 All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable
            for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
            righteousness:
         17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all
            good works.
   True and False religion:
     Psalm 51:
         1 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
           according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
           transgressions.
         2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
         3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin [is] ever before me.
         4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done [this] evil in thy
           sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, [and] be
           clear when thou judgest.
         5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive
           me.
         6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden
           [part] thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
         7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be
           whiter than snow.
         8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; [that] the bones [which] thou hast
           broken may rejoice.
         9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
         10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within
            me.
         11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit
            from me.
         12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me [with thy]
            free spirit.
         13 [Then] will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
            converted unto thee.
         14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation:
            [and] my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
         15 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
            praise.
         16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give [it]: thou
            delightest not in burnt offering.
         17 The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit: a broken and a
            contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
         18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of
            Jerusalem.
         19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,
            with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer
            bullocks upon thine altar.

   Study of The Gospel According to Saint John:
   Obey the Truth:
   First John 5:16:
      What does this riddle mean?
      16 If any man see his brother sin a sin [which is] not unto death, he
         shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.
         There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.
   Ezekiel 8 — Demon possesion:
   Clouds and Thick Darkness:
   KJV vs NIV:
      The NIV is slow poison and subtle as a snake.  And you know what the KJV
      says about the snake. Compare Gen 22:2, the NIV indicates GOD said
      sacrifice Isaac where the KJV say Offer as a sacrifice.  This is a big
      difference in the actual Nature of GOD, NIV is confusion, and GOD is not
      confused.  We all know who the author of confusion is. There is no wonder
      why there is such a 'Great falling away' Thank GOD, that he lead me away
      from the NIV.

      Jeremiah 23:
         5 ¶ Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto
           David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and
           shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.
         6 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and
           this [is] his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR
           RIGHTEOUSNESS.
         7 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no
           more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel
           out of the land of Egypt;
