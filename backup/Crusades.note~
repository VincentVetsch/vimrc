Crusades

   The ideas behind the Crusades and the reasons for todays civil unrest
   between Jewish, Muslims, and Christians.  Must probe the differences
   between the major religions and their commonalities.  Also, find out if 
   it is really religion or nationalism.  Is it really the fact that Christian
   and Jewish Nations truly live in the land of milk and honey.

   What will it take to mend the fences?  What are the repercussions?  Is it
   wise to fix the problem?  Is it possible to fix the problem?  Where Does GOD
   Fit in?  Where do the fallen angels fit in?

   The Crusades were a series of religious expeditionary wars blessed by Pope
   Urban II and the Catholic Church, with the stated goal of restoring
   Christian access to the holy places in and near Jerusalem.  Jerusalem was
   and is a sacred city and symbol of all three major Abrahamic faiths
   (Judaism, Christianity and Islam).  The background to the Crusades was set
   when the Seljuk Turks decisively defeated the Byzantine army in 1071 and cut
   off Christian access to Jerusalem.  The Byzantine emperor, Alexis I feared
   that all Asia Minor would be overrun.  He called on western Christian
   leaders and the papacy to come to the aid of Constantinople by undertaking a
   pilgrimage or a crusade that would free Jerusalem from Muslim rule.  Another
   cause was the destruction of many Christian sacred sites and the persecution
   of Christians under the Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim.[1]

   My preconceived ideas, are wild and undirected.  Some thoughts are not based
   in fact but opinion.  For instance, I think we all worship the same GOD, and
   the reasons for all of the fighting is whose name we use.  I also think that
   our religious leaders are to blame for all of it.  It stands to reason, when
   the ship is run aground the Captain is to blame, even if he was sound
   asleep, and the Officer Of the Deck was standing his post.  The ideas are
   the problem, everyone wants to be immortalized and the hero.  The point of
   this document is to add direction and substantiate my opinions.

   I believe the following Christ is my Savior, and I do not deserve
   forgiveness, because my sins murdered HIM.  The church is flawed full of
   liars, thieves, murderers, adulterers and idol worshippers.  The church
   is fractured and has to much dependency on dogma. Sometimes I feel the
   church wants wealthy parishioners over the poor, because of tithe.  I know
   this is not always the true, but I look at Tele-Evangelist and the large
   Gaudy churches and wonder.  I am not saying I am any better, I am
   lustful, a liar, and self righteous.  I do not go to any church, because
   of the flaws I have seen within the churches I have attended.  I believe
   Money corrupts all.

   As I am organising my thoughts and the time frame I am beginning to
   understand that is war will continue until one or both sides are destroyed.
   This war has been on going since the times of Adam and Eve.  It is not a war
   of religion, it is a war of control.  People use religion as a war flag, a
   banner to rally to.

Time Frame:
   • First Crusade 1095-1099
   • Crusade of 1101

The Holy Places:
   • The holy sites in cities for Christians of all denominations are:[2]

      Jerusalem's early 1st century walls that contains the Church of the Holy
      Sepulchre and the Church of All Nations, but many other Christian
      institutions as well. Jerusalem is believed to be the site of some of
      Jesus's teaching, the Last Supper which is believed to have occurred at
      the Cenacle, and the subsequent institution of the Holy Eucharist as well
      as His entombment; Christians believe he was crucified on a nearby hill.

      • The city of Bethlehem with the Church of the Nativity is believed to
      mark the birthplace of Jesus, and also the Shepherd's Fields in the
      neighboring village of Beit Sahour, the location of the angel's
      visitation to the shepherds to announce the birth of Christ.

      • Church of the Annunciation in Basilica and Mary's Well in Nazareth
      which is believed to be Jesus's hometown, and the site of other holy
      places.

      childhood

      • Nearby Jericho, the site called "Qasr el Yahud" on the western bank of
      the River Jordan, is the site of the Baptism of Jesus

      • Cave dwelling of John the Baptist

      Samaritan woman that he was the Messiah.
