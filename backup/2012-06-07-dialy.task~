                        ✓ nmap <leader>dd :/\(\<\w\+\>\)\_s*\1<cr>
                          ✓ The pattern searches for \<\w\+\> (word beginning \<, one or more word characters \w, word end \>), that is, it searches for a whole word. It then looks for any amount of whitespace (\_s*); \s matches space or tab, while \_s matches space or tab or newline (end-of-line character). Finally, the pattern looks for \1 which is the whole word that was found in the escaped parentheses.
