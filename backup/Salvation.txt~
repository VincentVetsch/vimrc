The Choice:
       Free will
               Life
               Death
Predestination:
       GOD knows all
               Pharoh in Exodus
               Judas in the Gospel
Philippians 2:
        12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in
        my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out
        your own salvation with fear and trembling.
PSALM 121:
        You cannot help (save) yourself
        The LORD is your keeper
        GOD shall preserve your soul, not your flesh
PSALM 140:
        You cannot save yourself, GOD is your salvation.
        You do fall into sin after you believe, after you commit a sin,
        the devil will say you cannot be saved, you should just give up.
               • Don’t believe a lie.
               • Repent and be steadfast
        Salvation is for those who want it.
        Backsliding
Proverbs 2:
        8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his
        saints.
        Think of paths, Like the ones that you followed as a child, you
        cannot go back to them.  The path has been corrupted.  Follow the
        incurruptable path.  The Bible, KJV seems to me to be the good path.
Proverbs 16:
        17 The highway of the upright [is] to depart from evil: he that
        keepeth his way preserveth his soul.
        18 Pride [goeth] before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a
        fall.
        19 Better [it is to be] of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to
        divide the spoil with the proud.
Jude 1:
        Preserve
II Corrinthians 1:
        21 
        Doesn’t move standing like a statue
        GOD Seals us
        Jesus is the only one that can unseal
Ephesians 1:
        13 
        Trust in GOD, Exodus 14.  Believe in Jesus.
        Trusted the word of truth.  KJV
        Gospel stands for ‘Good Tidings' Compair Isaiah 61 with Luke 4.
        The Gospel is the whole Bible, not just John 3:16
                16 ¶ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
                Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
                everlasting life.
Mark 4:
        Where the seed lands, wayside, stoney, thorns, and good ground.

        Do not JUDGE, GOD is not done yet.  Man cannot tell you that you are
        saved.  You must continue to work at getting rid of the thorns.  It
        must be continual. We all have thorns.

        Sin is Lust of the flesh, Lust of the eye, and pride of life.
Hebrews 6:
        4 
II Corrinthians 12:
Galations 5:
        All nine things describe the fruit.
