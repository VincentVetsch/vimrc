BASIC MOVEMENT 1

Slow movement – Character-wise movements with the home keys: h, j, k and l. The lesson here: DON’T use the arrow keys.

Line terminus – Beginning of line and end of line movements: 0 and $.

The different types of “words”

* words – represent a sequence of characters in the 'iskeyword' class.
* WORDs – represent a sequence of characters separated by whitespace.
* Run :help word and :help WORD

Forward word movement – We learn to move foward to the next WORD and word both to the beginning of words and the end of words. Commands are w, W, e and E.

Backward word movement – And we learn to move backward to the previous WORD and word both to the beginning of words and the end of words. Commands are b, B, ge and gE.

“To the Character” movement – The great, super great commands f, F, t, T and ; that let you move to specific characters within a line.


BASIC MOVEMENT 2

Paging – Moving the page up and down by full pages with CTRL-f and CTRL-b and by half pages with CTRL-u and CTRL-d.

Cursor jumping to screen parts – Moving to the head, middle and last line of a screen with H, M and L respectively.

Top and Bottom of the buffer – Jumping to the top line of the entire buffer with gg and the bottom of the entire buffer with G.

Jumping to a particular line – Get to a specific line number with <number>G.

Easy regular expression searching – The famous ‘*‘ and ‘#‘ keys for jumping by bounded regular expression.

Manual regular expression searching – Using ‘/‘ and ‘?‘ to manually search.


BASIC MOVEMENT 3

Start of Function or Class Jumping – Moving to the beginning of functions and classes backwards through the buffer with [[ and the beginning of functions and classes forwards through the buffer with ]] (assuming you code properly and put braces for these things in column 0 (hanging brace?? Come on! :D).

End of Function or Class Jumping – Forwards to the end of a function or class definition with ][ and backwards to the end of a function or class definition with [].

Jumping to Matching Braces – The fantastic % characters.

Marks – Basic mark functionality and how it works with m, ' and `.


BASIC EDITING 1
Starting an Insert – The main keys for getting into Insert Mode are i and I.  

Starting an Insert with a New Line – Another way to get into Insert Mode is with o and O for creating new lines.  

Starting an Insert with Append – You can also get into Insert Mode with a and A.  

Replacing Characters – You can replace characters (like turning off “insert” in Notepad) with r and R.  

Changing Things – You can change characters or motion related things using c and C.  

Deleting Characters – Delete a single character under the cursor with x and before the cursor with X.

Deleting Lines – Delete a single line with dd.

Repeat – One of the absolutely core and biggest features of Vi is something very simple: the ‘.‘ operator. Repeat the last command by hitting ‘.‘


BASIC EDITING 2

Yanking – Yanking is “copying” in the “lousy editor” vernacular and it’s done with the y key and Y key.

Putting – Putting is the inverse of yanking, and once you’ve yanked, you can put with the p key and P key.

Joining – You can join lines with the J key but it will put a space at the join position, so if you don’t want that to happen you need to use gJ.

Visual Mode – We cover the three Visual Modes using the v key for character-wise visual selection, V for line-wise selection and CTRL-v for block-mode selection. The all-important gv sequence is also covered to help you re-select an area you just selected.


WORKING WITH MANY FILES 1

Listing Buffers – Good ol’ ls is your friend here.

Switching Buffers – The buffer command gets you there and it can be used a ton of different ways.

Buffer deletion – The bdelete command is used to delete buffers and it can be used in an equally vast number of ways.
