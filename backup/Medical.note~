   Soduim Bicarbonate - baking soda [2]
        Sodium bicarbonate is used in an aqueous solution as an antacid taken
        orally to treat acid indigestion and heartburn. It may also be used
        in an oral form to treat chronic forms of metabolic acidosis such as
        chronic renal failure and renal tubular acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate
        may also be useful in urinary alkalinization for the treatment of
        aspirin overdose and uric acid renal stones. It is used as the
        medicinal ingredient in gripe water for infants. Sodium bicarbonate
        has been known to be used in first aid, in treating scalding, to
        prevent blistering and scarring with instructions to cover the scalded
        area with a liberal layer of sodium bicarbonate and water paste and
        seek medical assistance. This is due to the endothermic reaction that
        occurs between sodium bicarbonate and water and sodium bicarbonate's
        mild antiseptic properties.

        Intravenous sodium bicarbonate is an aqueous solution that is sometimes
        used for cases of acidosis, or when there are insufficient sodium or
        bicarbonate ions in the blood. In cases of respiratory acidosis,
        the infused bicarbonate ion drives the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer
        of plasma to the left and, thus, raises the pH. It is for this reason
        that sodium bicarbonate is used in medically supervised cardiopulmonary
        resuscitation. Infusion of bicarbonate is indicated only when the blood
        pH is marked (<7.1–7.0) low.

        It is used as well for treatment of hyperkalemia. Since sodium
        bicarbonate can cause alkalosis, it is sometimes used to treat aspirin
        overdoses. Aspirin requires an acidic environment for proper
        absorption, and the basic environment diminishes aspirin absorption in
        the case of an overdose. Sodium bicarbonate has also been used in the
        treatment of tricyclic antidepressant overdose. It can also be
        applied topically as a paste, with three parts baking soda to one part
        water, to relieve insect bites and stings (as well as accompanying
        swelling).

        Adverse reactions to the administration of sodium bicarbonate can
        include metabolic alkalosis, edema due to sodium overload, congestive
        heart failure, hyperosmolar syndrome, hypervolemic hypernatremia, and
        hypertension due to increased sodium. In patients consuming a
        high-calcium or dairy-rich diet, calcium supplements, or
        calcium-containing antacids such as calcium carbonate (e.g., Tums), the
        use of sodium bicarbonate can cause milk-alkali syndrome, which can
        result in metastatic calcification, kidney stones, and kidney failure.
        Sodium bicarbonate can be used to cover an allergic reaction of poison
        ivy, oak, or sumac to relieve some of the itching that is associated
        with it (an alternative to buying hydrocortisone cream).
        Bicarbonate of soda can also be useful in removing splinters from the
        skin.

        Cancer cells thrive in a low-oxygen environment. The body cannot
        retain oxygen cells if the blood pH is highly acidic, and this is the
        standard condition of those with tumors who eat a diet of refined
        sugars, flours, caffeine and other acidic foods. Baking soda, or
        Sodium Bicarbonate, is a substance that neutralizes acids. One
        teaspoon a week will reverse an acidic blood pH, as will switching to
        a diet high in alkaline-producing foods.[3]

        Because cancer cells are so hungry for sugars, when the baking soda is
        mixed with maple syrup, the mixture will go straight to the site of
        the tumor, like a Trojan Horse, where the bicarbonate will quickly
        work as a weapon against disease. A good recipe for this is to mix 3
        parts organic maple syrup with 1 part baking soda, stir over very low
        heat for 5-10 minutes and take 3 tsp per day for 1 to 2 months][3]

        "I found the article about Dr. Simoncini in Italy who injected baking
        soda directly into the tumors to kill them." Braun continues. "For
        some reason this idea struck a chord with me. Three weeks after
        taking a baking soda and maple syrup mixture, my tumor began to
        shrink and become softer. This was documented by my oncologist and
        the surgeon by physical exams and also measurements by ultrasound.
        The tumor shrank down to 1.7 centimeters then only to 1.4 centimeters
        2 months later after the ultrasound. It stopped shrinking because it
        had died. "[3]

Detox:
      In our travels we ran across this Appalachian Kidney Stone Flush.[5]

      Required: 6 pack of Classic Coca Cola ®, one 1 pound can of Asparagus.

      Directions: Drink 1 can of Coke every 20 minutes (takes two hours).  Eat
      the can of Asparagus and drink the juice immediately after drinking the
      last Coke. Retain all fluids for as long as possible before eliminating.
      Drink a minimum of 64 ounces of pure filtered/distilled water throughout
      the next 24 hours.

      The naturopath who shared this with us has seen some dramatic successes
      using this folklore recipe.

      Update: We had a reader write us that this was the best thing she's ever
      done.  She was just ecstatic over her results. Asparagus is very
      alkalizing and you should really check out the Asparagus Cancer Cure.
Diabetes:
      For people taking insulin for diabetes, blood sugar levels are often
      elevated in the morning. This is likely caused by inadequate amounts of
      NPH/Lente insulin before dinner or at bedtime. High morning insulin is
      referred to as either the dawn phenomenon or the Somogyi effect. 

      Dawn phenomenon: The dawn phenomenon is the end result of a combination
      of natural body changes that occur during the sleep cycle and can be
      explained as follows. Between 3:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m., your body starts
      to increase the amounts of counter-regulatory hormones (growth hormone,
      cortisol, and catecholamines). These hormones work against insulin's
      action to drop blood sugars. The increased release of these hormones, at
      a time when bedtime insulin is wearing out, results in an increase in
      blood sugars. These combined events cause your body's blood sugar levels
      to rise in the morning.

      Somogyi effect: This condition is named after the doctor who first wrote
      about it. It is also called "rebound hyperglycemia." Although the cascade
      of events and end result -- high blood sugar levels in the morning -- is
      the same as in the dawn phenomenon, the cause is more "man-made" in the
      Somogyi effect (a result of poor diabetes management). The term refers to
      pattern of high morning sugars preceded by an episode of hypoglycemia
      (usually with no symptoms, but night sweats can be a sign). Your blood
      sugar may drop too low in the middle of the night, so your body counters
      by releasing hormones to raise the sugar levels. This could happen if you
      took too much insulin earlier or if you did not have enough of a bedtime
      snack

   Important Tip:
      • Avoid All Trans-fats acids and hydrogenated oils.  All Canola Oil, All 
        Margarine
      • Remove Caffeine, remove Mountian Dew.
         ◦ Artificial Sweeteners may be worse than Sugar[6]

   Metamucil:
      • Helps with slowing down the absorption of sugar, helps reduce 
        cholesterol [13]
      • Is it okay to use Metamucil when you have diabetes?
         ▸  Metamucil (blond psyllium) is used as a laxative and stool
         softener. Blond psyllium is also used to treat bowel or intestinal
         conditions, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and
         certain types of cancer. Studies suggest that taking blond psyllium
         with foods can lower blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. Blond
         psyllium seems to reduce postprandial blood glucose levels by about 14
         percent to 20 percent. Blond psyllium also lowers cholesterol in
         people with diabetes who have high cholesterol. Some studies show
         blond psyllium can lower total cholesterol by about 9 percent, and LDL
         cholesterol by 13 percent. Blond psyllium should be taken with at
         least 8 ounces of water. In some people, blond psyllium might cause
         gas, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, and nausea. Maintaining a
         proper diet and exercise are important factors in diabetes control.

   Cinnamon:
      • Here are 10 Health Benefits of Cinnamon that may make you want to
      include it in your diet every day.[15]

            Lower Cholesterol — Studies have shown that just 1/2 teaspoon of
            cinnamon per day can lower LDL cholesterol.

            Blood Sugar Regulation — Several studies suggest that cinnamon may
            have a regulatory effect on blood sugar, making it especially
            beneficial for people with Type 2 diabetes.

            Yeast Infection Help — In some studies, cinnamon has shown an
            amazing ability to stop medication-resistant yeast infections.

            Cancer Prevention — In a study published by researchers at the U.S.
            Department of Agriculture in Maryland, cinnamon reduced the
            proliferation of leukemia and lymphoma cancer cells.

            Anti-Clotting — It has an anti-clotting effect on the blood.

            Arthritis Relief — In a study at Copenhagen University, patients
            given half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder combined with one
            tablespoon of honey every morning before breakfast had significant
            relief in arthritis pain after one week and could walk without pain
            within one month.

            Anti-Bacterial — When added to food, it inhibits bacterial growth
            and food spoilage, making it a natural food preservative.

            Brain Health — One study found that smelling cinnamon boosts
            cognitive function and memory.

            E. Coli Fighter — Researchers at Kansas State University found that
            cinnamon fights the E. coli bacteria in unpasteurized juices.

            High in Nutrients — It is a great source of manganese, fiber, iron,
            and calcium.
      • Contains methylhydroxychalcone polymer (MHCP)
         ▸ A 2003 study at National Institutes of Health shows benefits of
         cinnamon in diet of type 2 diabetics. "Cinnamon improves glucose and
         lipids of people with type 2 diabetes".[10]
            • The results of this study demonstrate that intake of 1, 3, or 6 g
            of cinnamon per day reduces serum glucose, triglyceride, LDL
            cholesterol, and total cholesterol in people with type 2 diabetes
            and suggest that the inclusion of cinnamon in the diet of people
            with type 2 diabetes will reduce risk factors associated with
            diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
         ▸ Can stimulate glucose uptake by our cells [1]
         ▸ “Dr. Anderson says that MHCP has effects similar to those of insulin 
           and works almost as well.” [1]
   Olives:
      Olives are a tremendously popular fruit that actually outnumber grapes,
      apples and oranges in total worldwide production. Their cultivation dates
      back over 5,000 years in the popular olive growing regions of Syria and
      Crete. The many diverse phytonutrients that olives provide make them a
      uniquely healthy food.[16]

      Here are 8 health benefits of olives:

      Cancer Prevention — Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress from free
      radical activity in the body are believed to greatly increase the risk of
      cancer development. Research suggests that the phytonutrients in olives
      may help reduce the chances of these conditions from occurring. One study
      found that these phytonutrients may help prevent cell growth activity in
      breast cancer and stomach cancer. The antioxidants in olives are also
      believed to help prevent DNA damage, another risk factor associated with
      cancer.

      High In Antioxidants — The many different phytonutrients found in olives
      act as antioxidants, reducing oxidative stress to a variety of body
      systems. Oleuropein is one such phytonutrient that is unique to olives.
      Research has shown oleuropein to reduce oxidative stress to LDL
      cholesterol, protect nerve cell damage and increase blood levels of
      glutathione, an essential antioxidant nutrient.

      Heart Health — The monounsaturated fat content found in olives has been
      linked to lower risk of cardiovascular disease. They help reduce blood
      pressure and balance cholesterol levels.

      Anti-Inflammatory — Whole olive extracts have antihistamine properties on
      a cellular level. Studies show that olives give a wide range of
      anti-inflammatory support, most notably to the cardiovascular system.

      Bone Health — Oleuropein taken from olives has been shown to help prevent
      bone loss in lab tests with rats. Further studies have linked olive
      consumption with good bone density and reduced risk of osteoporosis.

      High In Iron — One cup of olives provides over 24% of the DV of iron.
      Iron is essential for bone health, proper blood circulation and
      preventing illness caused by iron deficiency.

      High In Fiber — One cup of olives provides about 17% the DV of fiber.
      Fiber is great for colon health, helps balance the metabolism and
      controls body weight.

      Weight Loss — Foods high in dietary fiber can be great for weight loss.
      Though olives may not directly induce weight loss, their high fiber and
      healthy fat content content makes them a healthy addition to any
      effective weight loss program.
